Some examples for computing solutions to Hills equations (periodic)


Computes the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of a type of Hill's equation studied by Strutt M (1948). The even eigenvalue problem is determined by

$\frac{d^2\phi_{2n}}{dy^2} + \left[a_{2n} - qU(2y) \right]\phi_{2n} = 0$

subject to periodic boundary conditions

$\left.\frac{d\phi_{2n}}{dy}\right|_{y=0}  = \left.\frac{d\phi_{2n}}{dy}\right|_{y=\pi}=0$

and odd eigenvalue problem is determined by

$\frac{d^2\phi_{2n+2}}{dy^2} + \left[b_{2n+2} - qU(2y) \right]\phi_{2n+2} = 0$
